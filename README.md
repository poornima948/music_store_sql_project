#### Â Music Store Data Analysis



This project focuses on building and analyzing a music store database to strengthen SQL and data analysis skills.



The database includes:

\- Employee information

\- Customer details

\- Billing and invoice records

\- Music track metadata (albums, artists, genres)



Software Used: PostgreSQL



Data was restored into PostgreSQL using 'pgAdmin', with '.csv' files provided in this repository for reference .



The project features a collection of SQL queries of progressive complexity, applying different SQL concepts including filtering, aggregation, joins, and window functions to derive insights from the music store data.
